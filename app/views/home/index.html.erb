        In my portfolio section you will find links to the applications I created. They are deployed on heroku. I created my applications with rails and react or with rails exclusively. My porfolio and the friends app are  made with Ruby on Rails. The challenges section displays my technical proficiency with problem solving and my understanding of ruby. The most difficult challenges and projects are listed first. I also know how to work with SQL. The database used on all my projects was Postgresql.
